## Intro

## Setting up your machine

If you have an old yubikey setup already, or you have a new computer its pretty easy to get things working again.

Pretty simply you can just run the following:
```bash
brew install wget \
    gnupg \
    pinentry-mac
```

Setup your `gpg.conf` / `gpg-agent.conf` [covered below]()
You can see the lastest settings I use in my [dotfiles.](https://github.com/dacbd/dotfiles/tree/main/.gnupg)
Now on your new computer download your existing(public) keys, ex: `wget https://github.com/dacbd.gpg`
Import them: `gpg --import dacbd.gpg`

Optionally make sure everything is fine:
```
gpg -k
gpg --card-status
```

And that's it, your new computer is ready to go with your yubikey!
